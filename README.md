Earning Mechanics
For breaststroke and backstroke Mode:
SWN Rewards = N * WAEL*(WABA+ABA)^SWN value * α(P1,P2)F100
N = Number of SET burned.
WAEL = Weighted average of efficiency level Index.
WABA = Weighted average of efficiency level.
ABA = Additional bounce ability.
F = Ratio of average frequency per minute
α = Alpha coefficient
Parameter: A range of system values.
SWIMN value: Value set by the team. It changes following the percentage of users engagement.
For freestyle Mode
You will get a fixed reward of 10,000 SWN if over 2000 calories are burned per day.
If less than 2000 calories burned, SWN Rewards =(Actual Calories you burned - 800)/12100 For example, if only 1300 calories are burned today, you will earn (1300-800)/12100 = 4166.7 SWN as your freestyle mode reward.
For Extreme Sports Mode (Coming Soon)
Extreme Sports Mode can be used twice per week. You will need to record a video or start a live stream for your challenge. The likes and comments you got and the challenges' difficulties will be directly reflected in the rewards.
